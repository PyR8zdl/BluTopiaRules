## 2) Seeding Requirements
* **2.1** **Overview**:
    * **2.1.1** This is a sharing community. As you download, you are required to share back your part.
    * **2.1.2** You must maintain an overall ratio(link to ratio) of 0.4 or better to continue downloading.
    * **2.1.3** Check for other seeders before removing a torrent from your client.

    * **2.2.1** All torrents require a minimum of 7 days (168 hours) seedtime, REGARDLESS of ratio (link to wiki).
    * **2.2.2** Seedtime does not start until you have 100% of a torrent. Partial downloads (link to wiki) are NOT recommended for this reason.
    * **2.2.3** There is a 3% buffer before the minimum seeding requirements kick in. This means that torrents will not be considered a H&R if the amount you have downloaded is less than 3%.
    * **2.2.4** Seeding rules still apply to Freeleech torrents.
    * **2.2.5** Until you meeting the minimum seeding requirements, you must seed at least a little every 3 days (72 hours).

    * **2.2.7** If you have been disconnected for >72 hours (3 days) and haven’t seeded the minimum required time, you will receive a Hit and Run Warning (link to HnR warning).

    * **2.3.1** When you first receive an HnR warning, it will remain active for 14 days.
    * **2.3.2** After 14 days, the HnR warning will expire.
    * **2.3.3** Expired warnings are permanent marks on your account.
    * **2.3.4** If you have 1 active HnR warning, nothing happens.
    * **2.3.5** If you have 2 active HnR warnings, your download and request privileges are automatically disabled.
