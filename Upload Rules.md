> Further explanation of these rules and terms are available in the uploading section of our wiki as well as detailed uploading guide to walk you through the process.

> \* The listed bitrates are the recommended minimum. In some cases such as animated movies or series, a lower bitrate can be allowed. However, these are the absolute minimum and just because your encode meets the minimum requirements does not make it a proper quality encode. Quality for low bitrate content is subject to staff discretion on the basis of your encoding settings, media type, and screenshots and may be nuked even if you fulfill the above criteria.

        * **1.7.2** All files included in the upload should have a uniform resolution, source, format, and name. For example. They should all be 720p WEB-DLs by NTb or they should all be 1080p x264 BluRay encodes by AMIABLE, etc. Exceptions can be made if a uniform torrent is impossible. 
        * **1.7.3** Filenames MUST include the name, year (for movies), season/episode number (for TV shows), and the resolution at the minimum along with the source, codec, and origin information which is highly recommended, except when released by a group (see below).

        * **1.7.4** Individual files or folders uploaded by a group (scene or P2P) should not have their filenames altered in any way or under any circumstances, even if they don’t adhere to the guidelines above or below. File and folder names MUST match original file and folder names as released by the group at their homesite(s). If you obtained file(s) from a location that did change them from the original, you may rename it to its original form. 
        * **1.7.5** Do NOT remove group tags or replace group tags with your own EVER.
        * **1.7.6** Do NOT remove files or add files to an upload released by a group, unless it’s English subtitles added to foreign content.
        * **1.7.7** User releases by you must follow the naming conventions for the upload name and the filename.

* ###1.8 Naming Conventions:
    * **1.8.1 Movies:** `Movie Year Resolution Source Video Audio Codec-group`

        * **WEB-DL:** `The Giant Killer 2017 1080p AMZN WEB-DL DD+ 2.0 H.264-BLUTONiUM`
        * **BluRay Encode:** `Goodfellas 1990 1080p BluRay DTS 5.1 x264-DON`

    * 1.8.3 Naming Explanation
        * **Name** - Movie or show name. Include all proper punctuation (IE: ' , :)
        * **Year/Season** - Year the movie was released as specified by IMDB or the Season number in the format of S01 for Season 1, S02 for Season 2, etc. Individual episodes are named the same as their season directory with the episode specified as such: S01E01 for the first episode in season 1, S02E02, for the second episode in the second season, and S10E34 for the 34th episode in the 10th season.
        * **Resolution** - The resolution of the files you have uploaded. For SD content, it isn’t necessary to specify a resolution for the DVD or DVD-Remux. It is mandatory to specify the type of DVD, depending on region, NTSC or PAL.
        * **Source** - Which medium was the original release. For example, an encode made from a BluRay disc would mention “BluRay,” a download from the Amazon web service might say “AMZN WEB-DL” and a 1080p encode sourced from a 4k UHD BluRay disc might say “UHD BluRay.” For untouched raw BDs, it is recommended to include the region to the extent possible (US, AUR, EUR, NOR, etc.)
        * **A/V Codecs** - These codecs indicate the way the video and audio information was encoded. Allowed codecs are mentioned in the Format Rules here (LINK). While not strictly required, they are recommended, especially for some formats more than others (encodes, remuxes, web content).
        * **Group** - The name of the group that released the movie or episode(s). If the pack contains multiple groups, in the case where a uniform pack is impossible, you may label this field as MiXED implying the presence of multiple different groups in the pack.

> \* Note: Filenames must never be changed; however, the name you enter into Blutopia’s upload form is separate from the filenames. Your release name on Blutopia MUST conform to our naming schema even if the files themselves don’t. The Blutopia title is necessary to organize content and to make it easier to find the quality, resolution, source, and codecs one is looking for.

> \** Words like 4k REMASTERED, LIMITED, Director’s Cut, 3D are permitted when necessary. Since the cut of the film describes the film, you may include it before the resolution. Words describing the source such as REMASTERED MUST go before the Source same such as “UHD BluRay.”

* ###1.9 Trumping & Dupe Rules:
    * >Here, at Blutopia, we have a very limited trumping system aimed to keep content organized while offering an unmatched variety of content in various qualities. 
    * **1.9.1 Dupe:** For each title, each of the following can coexist for each resolution: one* Untouched BluRay (or DVD if not available in HD), one* BluRay remux (or DVD Remux if not available in HD), unlimited x264 and x265 encodes, 1 HDTV, unlimited WEBRips, 1 WEB-DL per .
        * **BluRays:** Additional BluRays for a single title are allowed to exist from another region as long as the video/audio are a different format/bitrate/quality, different subtitles, or an edition with other content not included on the other BluRays.
        * **Remux:** Additional remuxes are allowed to exist if the BluRay source is different as described above.
        * **WEB-DL:** Additional WEB-DLs are allowed to exist if the source provider is different (AMZN, RED, HULU, NETFLIX) and the video/audio quality/file size is different.
    * **1.9.2 Trumping:** Trumping is only allowed in the following cases:
        * 1.9.2.1 Torrent being trumped is defective in some way (audio/video glitches, out of sync audio, corrupted files, missing episodes, etc)
        * 1.9.2.2 Torrent being trumped is a remux that failed to include a commentary track present in the source disk.
        * 1.9.2.3 SD torrent when an HD+ version is released.
        * 1.9.2.4 TV Show season packs trump individual episodes of the same season, quality, and source.
        * 1.9.2.5 TV Show season pack WEB-DLs trump WEBRip season pack/ individual WEBRip episodes from the same source with the same resolution.
        * 1.9.2.6 A dead torrent (LINK to wiki) with last seedtime activity 3+ months ago.
        * 1.9.2.7 A dead torrent with an unanswered reseed request (1+ week) and last seedtime activity 1+ month ago.
