            > \* The listed bitrates are the recommended minimum. In some cases such as animated movies or series, a lower bitrate can be allowed. However, these are the absolute minimum and just because your encode meets the minimum requirements does not make it a proper quality encode. Quality for low bitrate content is subject to staff discretion on the basis of your encoding settings, media type, and screenshots and may be nuked even if you fulfill the above criteria.

    * **<a name="1.8.3">1.8.3 Naming Explanation</a>**
        * **Name** - Movie or show name. Include all proper punctuation (IE: ' , :)
        * **Year/Season** - Year the movie was released as specified by IMDB or the Season number in the format of S01 for Season 1, S02 for Season 2, etc. Individual episodes are named the same as their season directory with the episode specified as such: S01E01 for the first episode in season 1, S02E02, for the second episode in the second season, and S10E34 for the 34th episode in the 10th season.
        * **Resolution** - The resolution of the files you have uploaded. For SD content, it isn’t necessary to specify a resolution for the DVD or DVD-Remux. It is mandatory to specify the type of DVD, depending on region, NTSC or PAL.
        * **Source** - Which medium was the original release. For example, an encode made from a BluRay disc would mention “BluRay,” a download from the Amazon web service might say “AMZN WEB-DL” and a 1080p encode sourced from a 4k UHD BluRay disc might say “UHD BluRay.” For untouched raw BDs, it is recommended to include the region to the extent possible (US, AUR, EUR, NOR, etc.)
        * **A/V Codecs** - These codecs indicate the way the video and audio information was encoded. Allowed codecs are mentioned in the Format Rules here `(LINK)`. While not strictly required, they are recommended, especially for some formats more than others (encodes, remuxes, web content).
        * **Group** - The name of the group that released the movie or episode(s). If the pack contains multiple groups, in the case where a uniform pack is impossible, you may label this field as MiXED implying the presence of multiple different groups in the pack.

            > \* Note: Filenames must never be changed; however, the name you enter into Blutopia’s upload form is separate from the filenames. Your release name on Blutopia MUST conform to our naming schema even if the files themselves don’t. The Blutopia title is necessary to organize content and to make it easier to find the quality, resolution, source, and codecs one is looking for.

            > \** Words like 4k REMASTERED, LIMITED, Director’s Cut, 3D are permitted when necessary. Since the cut of the film describes the film, you may include it before the resolution. Words describing the source such as REMASTERED MUST go before the Source same such as “UHD BluRay.”
